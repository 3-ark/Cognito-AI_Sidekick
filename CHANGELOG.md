## [3.9.0] - 2024-07-20

* RAG citation format enhancement, now it's fully functional.
* Websearch is a tool now
* Polish tool use

*Note: 1. You have to use the same embedding model for your embedding and query.*
      *2. Current BM25 have a very good support for Latin languages, Cyrillic, Korean, Arabic, and Devanagari are fairly supported, Japanese should have a similar performance with Latin languages. For embedding, you have to use your favorite embedding models, this is the most important for the performance.*
      *3. Current RAG is still in optimization since there is no perfect library for a browser, I have to do more research to implement this myself. So it will be slow and buggy. But the good new is it's still working and getting better*

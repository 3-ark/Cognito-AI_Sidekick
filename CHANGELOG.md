### [3.9.5] - 2024-07-25

* Wikipedia is an independent tool from the old web search

* Enhanced web search by adding fallback retry when google search fails as default engine. (It won't record your ID search if you don't use your custom search)

* Fix language switcher for zh_CN and zh_TW

* Limit MCP to ws (sorry, it's too complicated for support all types and I don't think that's worth it.)
